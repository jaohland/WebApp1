            <h2>This page is all about the skins that dedicated fans have made for CS:GO</h2>
            <p>This page is dedicated to the different skins created over the years. Skins come in many different ways. You can receive a skin once a week for leveling your account.
            You can also receive skins buy opening cases. Cases require a key to open them. Keys cost $2.49 US, but there are some sites out there that will sell keys for lower.</p>
